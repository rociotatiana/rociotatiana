### About me 🐣

I'm a software engineer & anthropologist.

Currently doing a Master's in Data Science at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.
My project is focused in applying deep learning models for psycopathological factors prediction using multichannel EEG data (Neuroscience, Time Series). You can check our on-working repo [here](https://github.com/mcd-afg/eeg-prism) 🐝.

Even though my experience in software engineering is fairly new, I've had the oportunity to collaborate in awesome projects, which includes demographic data analysis and visualization (ODEGI), deep learning foundational models for astronomical data (ASTROMER), pipeline optimization in a time series backtesting product (Priax), and statistical analysis & unsupervised learning for a gender violence poll (Fundacion Antonia).

Given my anthropologist's background, I've been involved in a wide range of topics, such as gender violence, migrant youth, public health, ecological restoration and animal preservation iniciatives. 

If you have an idea that you think I may be interesed please reach out to me! 

👷 Currently working at Buk.
